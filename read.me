Key Concepts and Approach

    Backtracking with Recursion:

        Objective: Explore all possible ways to add parentheses while ensuring validity at each step.

        Mechanism: Use recursion to build combinations incrementally, backtracking when constraints are violated.

    Constraints for Validity:

        Opening Parentheses: Add ( only if the count of ( used so far is less than n.

        Closing Parentheses: Add ) only if the count of ) is less than the count of ( (ensuring proper nesting).

    Base Case:

        When the current combination's length reaches 2n (all pairs are used), add it to the result list.

Step-by-Step Explanation

    Initialization:

        Start with an empty string and track the counts of ( and ) used.

    Recursive Exploration:

        Add ( if possible: When the number of ( is less than n, append ( and increment its count.

        Add ) if possible: When the number of ) is less than (, append ) and increment its count.

        Base Case Check: If the combination's length is 2n, save it as a valid result.

    Backtracking:

        After exploring a path (e.g., adding (), the recursion unwinds (backtracks) to explore alternative paths (e.g., adding ) instead).

Example Walkthrough (n = 2)

    Start: Empty string. Open = 0, Close = 0.

    Add ( → (: Open = 1, Close = 0.

        Add ( → ((: Open = 2, Close = 0.

            Add ) → ((): Open = 2, Close = 1.

                Add ) → (()): Length = 4 → valid result.

        Backtrack to (:

            Add ) → (): Open = 1, Close = 1.

                Add ( → ()(: Open = 2, Close = 1.

                    Add ) → ()(): Length = 4 → valid result.

Why This Works

    Systematic Exploration: The recursion tries all valid choices at each step, ensuring no valid combination is missed.

    Constraint Enforcement: The rules for adding ( and ) guarantee that only properly nested parentheses are formed.

    Efficiency: Invalid paths are abandoned early (e.g., closing a parenthesis before opening it), reducing unnecessary computation.

Study Focus

    Backtracking: Understand how recursion explores and prunes decision trees.

    Recursive State Management: Track parameters like current string and parenthesis counts.

    Constraint Validation: Learn how rules ensure valid combinations without explicit checks.
